      <h3>TARC</h3>
      <p>As a part of my engineering class in high school i participated in a rocketry competition where I worked in with a team of 7 students to design, create, and fly a rocket from scratch. The competition has taught me how to work with and, at times, manage a team of people. It also taught me how to manage time and resources to efficiently and accurately finish assignments and projects.</p>
