        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>I am currently a high school student that spends much of their time with either some type of musical instrument, or researching for their next engineering project. I am a very determined person when it comes to completing a project and getting it done right. I often strive for perfection and make schedules for myself to get a project or assignment done. I also enjoy reading.</p>

        <h3>Working Environment</h3>
        <p>I am a very different person when it comes to work. I usually hate to waste time when i know there's something i could be doing instead. I always try to transcend my goals and work hard to get ahead.</p>
